# BabySoC Design & Tapeout Program

Welcome to my repository documenting my progress in the BabySoC Tapeout Program!

This repository organizes my weekly tasks into dedicated folders, `Part1` and `Part2`, reflecting my journey through the design and validation of a System-on-Chip (SoC).

> This program focuses on designing a System-on-Chip (SoC) from RTL to GDSII using open-source tools.  
> It is part of a collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative in India, enabling thousands of participants to contribute to the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem.

## 📅 Week 2 — BabySoC Fundamentals & Implementation

| Task | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| [Part 1](./Part1/Week2_Part1.md) | Explore BabySoC fundamentals and functional modeling | ✅ Completed |
| [Part 2](./Part2/Week2_Part2.md) | Perform practical implementation and functional simulation | ✅ Completed |

### 🌟 Key Learnings from Week 2

- Gained an understanding of the BabySoC architecture, including its RISC-V CPU, PLL, and DAC components.
- Successfully set up a Python environment and used SandPiper SaaS to convert TL-Verilog to standard Verilog for simulation.
- Conducted pre-synthesis simulation using Icarus Verilog and visualized results with GTKWave to verify the design’s behavior.
- Analyzed key signals such as reset, PLL feedback, and DAC output to confirm correct functionality.
